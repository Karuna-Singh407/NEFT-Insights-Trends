While exploring India’s fast-evolving digital payment ecosystem, I realized that NEFT (National Electronic Funds Transfer) plays a crucial yet under-discussed role in interbank and high-value transactions. Unlike UPI, NEFT processes bulk payments, corporate transactions, and scheduled transfers—making it a backbone of digital banking operations.
What fascinated me was that even though NEFT is 24x7, banks still face issues like:
Delays during peak hours (e.g., month-end)
High reversal rates
Cases of fraud using fake payment confirmations

This led me to think:

“Can we use data visualization to bring clarity into NEFT trends, spot hidden issues, and support operational improvements?”

That curiosity drove me to take up this Power BI project.

Step 1: Data Cleaning & Preparation
Since the data involved transaction amounts, timestamps, the first challenge was making it analysis-ready.

Key data cleaning actions in Power BI (Power Query Editor):-
Converted raw date-time into separate Date, Hour, and Month columns.
Handled missing or null values in transaction fields.
Formatted amount columns to appropriate numeric types.
Removed duplicate entries (if any) for accurate aggregation.
DAX Functions (calculated columns,measures) are performed.

This step ensured the dataset was reliable and structured for time-series and category-wise insights.

Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
With clean data, I performed EDA using Power BI visualizations to extract insights across time dimensions and transaction outcomes.

Key areas of analysis:

Monthly Trends
To check for spikes during salary dates or month-end settlement periods.

Debit vs Credit Amount Patterns
Helped identify inconsistencies—useful in detecting fraudulent transactions where debits are claimed but not credited.

Reversal Trends
Tracked periods or conditions where transaction reversals were abnormally high.

All charts were made interactive using slicers (month, time block, status), cards (KPIs), and conditional formatting for easy pattern detection.
